# THE INCREDIBLE PALINDROME CHECKING CAT
## My spin on the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Palindrome Checker exercise

- I did this exercise on freeCodeCamp, then copied the code over to my CodePen to play
around with the visual elements.

- JavaScript unchanged from freeCodeCamp lesson code.
- CSS changed to produce nice colors, borders, rounded corners etc.
- HTML changed in multiple places, and to add image of my incredible cat.
